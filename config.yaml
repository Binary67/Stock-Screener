# Allocation filtering
# TopN is a fraction (0.0â€“1.0). Example: 0.2 keeps the top 20% tickers by ranking.
# Backward compatible: values >1 and <=100 are treated as percent (e.g., 20 -> 0.2).
TopN: 0.5

# Ranking weights for AssetRanking module (higher is better for all listed metrics)
RankingWeights:
  SortinoRatio: 0.15
  SharpeRatio: 0.25
  NegMaxDrawdown: 0.15
  CAGR: 0.35
  UlcerPerformanceIndex: 0.10

# Allocation blend between ranking and volatility
# You can also set `RankingWeight: 0.7` instead; if both values are provided,
# they are normalized so the relative shares drive the blend.
AllocationWeights:
  Ranking: 0.7
  Volatility: 0.3
